        <h4 class="section-title">UCMG Clinic Managing Admin</h4>
        <p>UCMG sought a professional digital solution capable of meeting the diverse needs of all users, including staff, doctors, nurses, and patients. The existing processes relied on manual tasks and an outdated system that involved physical medical cards and manual data entry. Consequently, real-time information updates were lacking, leading to communication delays and a lack of transparency in the operational workflow.</p>
